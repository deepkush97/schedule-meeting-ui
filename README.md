# Schedule Meeting UI

- This application is made with `next.js`, `react.js`, `tailwindcss` and `typescript`;

  - Next.js provides easy project setup, integration with tailwind and provides code splitting and build process which can be useful in deployment the project to different platforms.
  - Tailwind CSS is an utility framework for css which gives a lot of basic classes which can be mixed and matched to build UI, media query properties and other wiz.
  - Typescript is a typed language of javascript considered as super set of it, provides good support and intellisense and provides compile time error rather than burning hole at production time.

- I have created the toast by myself, rather than using third party library using context api.
